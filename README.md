# PokemonAPI

This app shows a list of pokemon that will display a modal with more information when the user clicks each pokemon. It utilizes a [pre-built API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=20). The modal showcases the name of the pokemon,a front and back picture, height, and types. Main strategy of the code is wrapping everything within an IIFE and only accessing it's protected data when called upon.

## Thing to Improve

I moved on to the list app I'm building before finishing up the styling of the pokemonAPI with Bootstrap. I will add the framework, as well as pull more information for the modal to display. I also limited the API url to _/?limit=20_ for testing, but will likely increase that number depending on laod times.
